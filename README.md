# git-terminal-linux

Beautifies linux terminal for git.
If you are tired of using simple terminal without autofill feature and colored output then this script is for you.

## Installation

just clone this repo / download as a zip and unzipt it.

Move to repo directory:

`$ cd git-terminal-linux`

and then run the script:

`$ ./install_git_terminal.sh`

And you are done!

**Important** : This script clears `~/.bash_profile` file in your home directory. But before clearing, it creates a backup file `~/.bash_profile_backup` so make sure you append your changes in bash_profile from bash_profile_backup. If you have not touched `~/.bash_profile` before, you are good to go no need to change anything.
